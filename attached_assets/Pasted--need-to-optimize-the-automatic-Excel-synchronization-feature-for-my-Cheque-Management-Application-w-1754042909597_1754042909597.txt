 need to optimize the automatic Excel synchronization feature for my Cheque Management Application with the following requirements:

Create New Cheque:

When a new cheque is created in the application, it should be automatically added to the correct Excel file and sheet (e.g., monthly sheets like January, February, etc.).

The system should record the exact sheet name and row number where this cheque is inserted.

Update Existing Cheque:

When an existing cheque is updated, the system must locate the exact original sheet and row in the Excel file where this cheque was first recorded.

The update must overwrite only that rowâ€™s data in the original sheet without moving or duplicating the cheque entry elsewhere.

For example, if a cheque was initially stored in the May sheet, any update to this cheque must reflect in the same May sheet and same row in the Excel file.

Sheet & Row Tracking:

Implement a mechanism to remember and store the mapping between each cheque and its original sheet name and row position for future synchronization.

This mapping must be stored persistently (in a database or metadata file) to ensure updates always sync correctly.

Multi-Sheet Handling:

The Excel workbook contains multiple sheets per month (or other categories). The synchronization must handle all sheets without mixing data.

New cheques should be added to the correct monthly sheet based on the cheque date or category.

Prevent Duplicate Entries:

Ensure that synchronization logic does not create duplicate cheque records in any sheet.

Updates should only modify existing entries.

Real-Time & Batch Sync:

Support both real-time synchronization when a cheque is created or edited, and batch synchronization if multiple changes happen offline or at once.

Error Handling & Data Integrity:

Add error handling to prevent data loss or corruption during synchronization.

Validate cheque data before syncing to Excel.

Goal:
Build a robust, efficient, and error-free Excel synchronization system that keeps all cheque data perfectly aligned with the original Excel sheets where they were first recorded, maintaining historical accuracy and preventing duplication.
